  <p> My name is David Sheppard, I was born in Cleveland Ohio on January 30, 1989. Both of my parents are teachers, my mom worked in the Cleveland heights school district and my dad was a principle for a school for children with learning disabilities called PEP.  I have two younger brothers and a younger sister, along with a big dumb yellow lab named hunter and a little, much more intelligent dog named naia. I have been to almost every state in this country however I have never been on foreign soil, I hope to one day go to every continent, (yes even Antarctica). I grew up playing and loving almost every sport however there is only one that truly has my heart, and that is baseball.</p>
